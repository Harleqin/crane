  \title{Appendix B: How Crane is tested}

  Crane previously used Vagrant and shell scripts to define and provision a
  virtual machine for running database servers. To make testing easier, we now
  use Travis CI, and the project's \c{.travis.yml} file defines how everything
  is set up and run. The tests are run on the cloud and on every branch, so
  contributors can see whether their changes build or fial.
