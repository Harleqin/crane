  \title{Inflate/Deflate}

  Crane supports \i{inflating} values returned by the database into more complex
  CLOS objects, and \i{deflating} those same objects back to an SQL
  representation. This can be useful for accessing database extensions that
  provide complex types for columns, like Postgres'
  \link[uri=http://postgis.net/]{PostGIS}.

  Examples:

  \code[lang=lisp]{(definflate (stamp 'timestamp)
  ;; Inflate a timestamp value
  ;; into a timestamp object
  (local-time:universal-to-timestamp stamp))

(defdeflate (stamp local-time:timestamp)
  ;; Deflate a timestamp object
  ;; into a string
  (local-time:format-timestring nil stamp))
  }
}
