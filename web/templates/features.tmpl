    <h3>Not opinionated</h3>
    <p>Crane doesn't drink the ORM Kool Aid: You won't spent a single minute
      struggling with an interface that claims to be "simple" yet forces you
      into a limited vision of how databases should work.</p>
    <p>To make simple queries, Crane has a simple interface. For more complex
      stuff, use the <a href="https://github.com/fukamachi/sxql">SQL query DSL</a>.
      If you like plain old fashioned SQL, you can use that too &mdash; Crane
      doesn't judge.</p>
    <h3>Explicit without being verbose</h3>
    <p>Crane doesn't create tables you don't know about, implicitly follow
      relations, or generate any unexpected SQL. There are no surprises here.</p>
